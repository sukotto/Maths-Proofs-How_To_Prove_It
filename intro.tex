1.(a.) Factor $2^15 - 1 = 32,767$ into two smaller positive integers\\
       7, 4681\\
  (b.) Find an integer x such that $1 < x < 2^{32767} - 1$ and $2^{32767} - 1$ is divisible by x.\\
127 i.e. $2^7 - 1$.\\

$n$&Is n prime?&$3^n - 1$&Is $3^n - 1$ prime?\\

Based on the values of the table I conjecture that $3^n - 1$ is always even, and so is never prime.\\

3. Euclid's theorem\\
(a.) Find a prime different from 2,3,5 and 7.\\
   $Let m = 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 + 1 = 211$\\
   $211$ is prime
(b.) Find a prime different from 2,5 and 11.\\
     Let m $ = 2 * 5 * 11 + 1 = 111$\\
     $ 111$ has the factor 3, which is different to the primes above.\\
\linebreak
4. Find five consecutive integers that are not prime.\\
Let $n = 5$ and let $x = (n + 1)! + 2 = 722$\\
722,723,724,725 and 726 are not prime.\\
727 is prime.\\
